# Analyzing-Human-Emotions-with-DeepFace-and-TensorFlow
This project uses DeepFace to detect emotions from facial expressions. By analyzing real-time data, it classifies emotions like happiness, sadness, and anger. Built with TensorFlow, the system enables accurate emotion recognition for diverse applications, enhancing user experience through AI-driven analysis.

Technologies Used:
DeepFace 🧠 A deep learning library that provides tools for facial recognition and emotion analysis.

TensorFlow 🔥A powerful open-source framework for building and training AI models, used here for emotion recognition.

Python 🐍The programming language used for implementing the emotion analyzer project.

OpenCV 📸A computer vision library for image processing and handling video streams.

Flask (Optional) 🌐A web framework (optional) for deploying the emotion analyzer as a web application.
